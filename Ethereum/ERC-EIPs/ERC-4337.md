[[Account Abstraction]] [[ERC-EIPs]]

The Ethereum blockchain has deployed a feature known as “[account abstraction](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/11/ethereum-upgrade-could-make-it-harder-to-lose-all-your-crypto/),” seen as a key enhancement that could make it easier for users to recover crypto if they lose private keys to an online wallet.

The new standard, formally known as ERC-4337, was deployed via a [smart contract called EntryPoint](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0576a174D229E3cFA37253523E645A78A0C91B57#code).

Part of the reason why ERC-4337 was so easy to deploy is because the upgrade was made via the [addition of a smart contract](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/account_abstraction_roadmap#Transaction-inclusion-lists), **so it didn’t require any changes to Ethereum’s underlying programming**, which would be complicated to implement. This proposal just adds a new layer atop Ethereum’s mainnet layer. The goal is to eventually integrate account abstraction into the main protocol.

The issue with EOAs comes down to human error – if a user loses their private keys, there is no way to recover that. Account Abstraction addresses the issues of an EOA account by merging it with a CA (Contract Accounts) – therefore creating built-in mechanisms that can allow users to keep access to their crypto.
