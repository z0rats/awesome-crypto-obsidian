# OSWAR - Open Standard Web3 Attack Reference

Security Framework for Decentralized Technologies (Web3)

OSWAR (Open Standard Web3 Attack Reference) is a comprehensive framework that identifies, categorizes, and mitigates Web3-related attacks and vulnerabilities. Inspired by the MITRE ATT&CK framework, OSWAR provides a structured, comprehensive, and actionable understanding of attacker behaviors, techniques, and vulnerabilities related to decentralized systems like blockchain platforms and decentralized applications (dApps). By providing detailed information and guidance on securing blockchain platforms, decentralized applications, and other Web3 technologies, OSWAR aims to foster a safer and more secure ecosystem for the future of decentralization.
